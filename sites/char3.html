    Sans is a major character from the game <i>Undertale</i>. He is a relatively short skeleton that is always seen with a smile on his face. He resides in the town of Snowdin in the Underground with his brother, Papyrus. His powers are teleportation, telekinesis, the ability to manifest bones and bone creatures that can shoot energy beams out of thin air, and the ability to remember what you've done in your previous game save files or from his perspective, other timelines. He is the final boss of the game's "Genocide Route," popular for how hard and sometimes unfair the fight is. <br>
