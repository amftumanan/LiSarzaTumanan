      Exusiai is an upbeat, generally cheery and optimistic young lady. As expected from a Sankta, (race based on angels) she has a burning passion for guns, and wishes for eight new guns when she is promoted. (When she is promoted again, her wish comes true!) She's often paired with her co-worker and partner Texas, who's the more level-headed and serious one in the duo. (In fact, in the entire group)

  <caption><h3>Why do people like Exusiai?</h3></caption>
  <tr class="character">
    <td>
      Exusiai was voted as the most popular operator in a poll. Why is that? First, a lot of people admire her from a gameplay perspective, as she deals a good amount of burst damage with little to no effort. In a character perspective, there's also something to cover. Exusiai's liveliness and energetic behavior is a fun part of her character, and her character design, while simple, is very memorable.
