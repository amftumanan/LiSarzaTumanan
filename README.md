/ Carefully Categorizing Character Qualities
By/9-Lithium students Jaycee Sarza and Abren Marner Tumanan.

This website functions similarly to a wiki page. The home page contains the links which each lead to the webpages containing the main body of the website. Each webpage details a fictional character of our choosing. Information that can be found on the webpage may include: work of origin, description of appearance and behaviour, relevance of character to the plot of the work of origin, and many more. We currently have 3 characters: Exusiai from Arknights, Mika Kagehira from Ensemble Stars, and Sans from Undertale. There is also a secret (and very scuffed) Sans battle simulator with prize money if you beat the challenge.

The next update will have many more characters and probably simulators to their respective source materials.
