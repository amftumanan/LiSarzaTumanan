# Carefully Categorizing Character Qualities
By 9-Lithium students Jaycee Sarza and Abren Marner Tumanan.

This website functions similarly to a wiki page. The home page contains the links which each lead to the webpages containing the main body of the website. Each webpage details a fictional character of our choosing. Information that can be found on the webpage may include: work of origin, description of appearance and behaviour, relevance of character to the plot of the work of origin, and many more. (The characters are yet to be decided.)
